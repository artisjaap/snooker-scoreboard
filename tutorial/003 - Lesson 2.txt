Now that we have our basic datamodel. It is time to create some actions. We want to:
- create a player
- create a match for two players
- add a frame to an existing match
- request match statistics (for now, player names, intermediate position, current frame)

*hint, intermediate position: If game is finished, you can determine who's the winner
       current frame is the one without endDate



motivation
----------

- Player is not a stand-alone action. Players are part of a match and cannot exist on their own (for now)
- A createMatch action is implemented
- A matchSummary action is implemented
- An AddFrameToMatch is created and is intended to add completed frames. In the next lesson the concept of a
  'currentFrame' will be introduced and this might change this action
