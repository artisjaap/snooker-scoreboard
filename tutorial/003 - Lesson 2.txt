Now that we have our basic datamodel. It is time to create some actions. We want to:
- create a player
- create a match for two players
- add a frame to an existing match
- request match statistics (for now, player names, intermediate position, current frame)

*hint, intermadiate position: If game is finished, you can determine who's the winner
       current frame is the one without endDate
