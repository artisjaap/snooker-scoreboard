So far, we have built a small working scoreboard with some basic testing but there is
still a lot to come. What about fault points, what about validation (when some scores 2 and then 3 points?)

In the next lesson we will start to interact with this scoreboard through a REST-interface.
We will also make the scoreboard multitanent (why would we otherwise need a server in the first place?)
Multi tenant means that we want to be able to serve different matches at the same time.
We also need some kind of validation so that a user who created a match is the only one who can update the match
but we would like to share a view on this match for all who are interested.
