In this lesson we will introduce some security. This is what we would like:
- when a new match is created, the user receives also a username/password to modify the match
- the authenticated user can only change his match
- there is one public endpoint that views the match statistics

For authentication, we will use spring security with JWT (Json WebToken)

For simplicity, we will extend the Match Entity with username/password fields instead of creating a new Authentication Entity
This might change in the future when we need more features.
