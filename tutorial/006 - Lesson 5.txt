Actually, we now have a basic implementation of a scoreboard:
- we can create a match for two players
- we can start a new frame
- we can add points
- we can alter the players
- and we can continue with a new frame
Write some end-2-end testing with cucumber behaviour driven tests

motivation
----------
- matchsimulation.feature is a cucumber scenario that can be executed to validate the current implementation
