Now that we have our first actions where we can create a match and add a frame,
we need something to keep track of the current frame in progress of the match.
For this we need a new Entity: CurrentFrame which is an optional 1:1 mapping on the match.
We should keep track of, score for both players. The player currently playing, current break
(which is the number of points scored without missing a ball) and something to keep track of the number of
points still available to score.

Snooker is played with 15 red balls (1point each), a yellow (2 points), green (3 points), brown (4 points),
blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and black (7 points). After every red ball an other color has to be taken,
after a color, again a red ball is to be taken and so on. When no reds are left, the colors are played
in ascending value. This makes a total of (1 + 7)*15+2+3+4+5+6+7=147 points at the start of a frame.
