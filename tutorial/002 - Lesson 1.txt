In the first lesson we will build a minimal datamodel which is capable to save scoring.
Snooker is played with two players. A player should have a name and first name.
Every game in snooker is called a Frame, a Frame should have the score of both players.
It should also contain the start- and end-time of the frame.
Finally, we have a match, witch links the two players together with the frames they played. In addition
it should contain the date on which the match is played and the number of frames that decides the match.
